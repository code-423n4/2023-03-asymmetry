I am confuzed by _disableInitializers() in every constuctor, won't this make the contract non initializable? Before even the owner can initialize it.

https://gist.github.com/muratkurtulus/c7a89b0ef411b5b96dd8af23ccd95dc4#l-2-initializers-could-be-front-run
in the constructor they set _disableConstructor() and they init the value in the hardhat in the deployment script

yes, other stuff such as use assembly to check for address(0) are wrong as well, because it doesn't save gas

Hi @Toshi  derivative contract has modifier `onlyOwner` on deposit and withdraw function, Does safETH contract own that ownership?

[03/25/2023 16:13] to_sh_i_
Yea I haven't realized how big foundry has blown up and people expect tests written in that.  I think it makes sense for those developers who don't have a JS background


[03/25/2023 16:13] to_sh_i_
I like hardhat's tooling, but think we can implement tests in solidity in the future


[03/25/2023 16:14] road220
for instance, looking at this test case you would understand that the owner of derivative contracts is safETH 😄

Foundry is usually faster and easier to read and understand (for example, most code editors allow you to jump directly to a function definition from a function call in a test).
But your tests are still very good

`_disableInitializers()` is used to avoid initializing the implementation contract by anybody, but won't touch the proxy since the proxy is using delegatecall, so the proxy storage not the implementation

[03/27/2023 17:58] aga7hokakological
does this mean weight is not dependent on derivatives number? Like as if there are 3 derivatives each has 33/33/33 and if added 4th it will be 25/25/25/25. You can adjust them but in general it'll be like this only right?

[03/27/2023 18:05] to_sh_i_
Yes weights are set only relative to each other.  So if you wanted to set weights as 50, 50, 900 then the distribution would be 5%, 5%, and 90%

@Toshi can we have your help on this?


[03/27/2023 19:01] to_sh_i_
So each token representation towards ETH changes over time.  For instance, 1 wstETH today might be equal 1.1 ETH and in a year 1 wstETH might be equal to 1.3 ETH.  The safETH that is minted is minted as a percentage ownership of the entire value of the protocol.  So whenever you withdraw your safETH you get whatever percentage of the total protocol's worth of ETH

hi, what is the reason behind a min/max staking amount? which situations are you trying to prevent? also, are the current defaults meant to change often?


[03/28/2023 11:54] road220
the min/max staking amount assertion should exist. Lido has some kind of checks like that upon depositing to prevent precision loss issues when computing stETH amounts for instance. 
Also, the withdrawal feature in feature/shapella-upgrade contains some max/min amounts to process withdrawals by little chunks of 100ETH, the min amount prob for preventing withdrawal spam, although it's not that much relevant, since the logic implemented by the Lido doesn't fully rely on the whole withdrawal queue, i.e. every single operation is performed with O(1) time complexity in average. Probably, finalization of the withdrawals batch requires O(log(n)), where n - number of withdrawals, but log(n) is not something that could cause some issues

It is the derived price of the token given the value of the underlying derivatives the contract holds before the new derivatives are purchased

How rebalanceToWeights() can cause bad slippage which is written in comments? Explain?


[03/29/2023 19:32] codingnamekiki
You mean adding new compromised derivative in order for the owner to steal funds from the stakers. Sounds too unrealistic to be taken as medium, but perhaps might be taken for QA as it is mentioned only for medium in the automated findings.


[03/29/2023 19:33] dingo2077
exactly, just set 0/0/0/100 weight and call rebalance


[03/29/2023 19:33] road220
Because you have to  invoke a withdraw() on a secondary market, like on Curve. Where the excepted slippage is about 1% by now. Therefore expected loses could vary between 0-1%

why `derivatives[i].balance()` is passed to `ethPerDerivative` ?


[03/29/2023 22:32] Franfran#5067
that's because it's calculating the underlying balance in ETH of the derivative pool


[03/29/2023 22:38] ubl4nk#1934
I don't think so, in wstETH and SfrxETH this parameter is unused but Reth contract is checking that this amount can be deposited to the  RocketPool or not.


[03/29/2023 22:39] Franfran#5067
because it's requesting the Derivative <> ETH exchange rate, so for 1 ETH


[03/29/2023 22:40] Franfran#5067
or 1 derivative token, wathever

You're right, they could have used the "amount" but for consistency reasons they didn't. The function is called `ethPerDerivative`, implying there is only One derivative token

i know centralization risks are out of scope but are other issues in the onlyOwner tagged functions acceptable?


[03/29/2023 22:57] ubl4nk#1934
What is the maximum deposit?
I’ll save you another scroll, there is no limit.


[03/29/2023 22:57] ubl4nk#1934
what does it mean ?😂


[03/29/2023 22:57] ubl4nk#1934
i copied this text from their page


[03/29/2023 22:58] 0xtraub
i mean `rocketDAOProtocolSettingsDeposit.getMaximumDepositPoolSize()` is a valid function


[03/29/2023 22:58] 0xtraub
i checked


[03/29/2023 22:58] 0xtraub
and it returns 5000 eth


[03/29/2023 22:58] ubl4nk#1934
` rocketDepositPool.getBalance()` what will return ?


[03/29/2023 23:01] ubl4nk#1934
ok it returns 5000000000000000000000


[03/29/2023 23:02] ubl4nk#1934
but am not sure exactly


[03/29/2023 23:03] ubl4nk#1934
could you explain a bit about the `centralization risks` ? what types of risks they are


[03/29/2023 23:04] 0xtraub
like bad things that could happen if the owner of the contract decided to go rogue or was compromised

[03/29/2023 23:04] 0xtraub
for example like pausing the contract and then renouncing ownership would render it unusable forever.

rebalanceToWeights () what are the rare conditions in which it'll be called?


[03/30/2023 03:27] aga7hokakological
When adding new derivative?


[03/30/2023 03:29] aga7hokakological
When eth is divided amongst these derivatives each derivative has its own wrapped token which is getting minted to this contract right?


[03/30/2023 07:14] road220
RocketPool doesn't have any upper limits for individual deposits.


[03/30/2023 07:22] road220
Currently, RocketPool is busy. Only validators submit deposits via flashbots bundles by creating minipools. That amount is used to check whether it passes the following checks. And this check has nothing to do with the upper limit check per deposit.

[03/30/2023 12:04] loserdavictor
```address public constant WST_ETH =
        0x7f39C581F595B53c5cb19bD0b3f8dA6c935E2Ca0;
    address public constant LIDO_CRV_POOL =

    address public constant STETH_TOKEN =
        0xae7ab96520DE3A18E5e111B5EaAb095312D7fE84;```
can some one explain me the role of these three, 
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/main/contracts/SafEth/derivatives/WstEth.sol#L13 

the first one is erc_20 wrapped_eth the second one is lido_pool but third one? like clarify the roles a little


[03/30/2023 12:06] road220
it's not a role, it's the address of the stETH


[03/30/2023 12:06] loserdavictor
the role of that address


[03/30/2023 12:09] co0nan
when unwrap called, it exchange WST_ETH for SftETH, this address simple holds the contract balance of SftETH. It then approves the LIDO pool to spend it in order to exchange it for ETH.

[03/30/2023 12:09] road220
gotcha! 
stETH is rebasable token, therefore dapps should operate with wstETH in order to hold some balances etc... 
If you look into the function withdraw(), u'll see that it first unwraps some wstETH and then performs a swap in stETH/ETH pool on curve.

[03/30/2023 12:10] road220
If Asymmetry didn't implement this mechanism with unwrapping, users would lose their rewards occurred over the time.


[03/30/2023 12:11] loserdavictor
yep, i saw that and i also saw that we are using pool in deposit and withdraw and more things so it was sus 🙂

Hi @Toshi apologies, you can ignore my request, I deleted the message.

{Reactions}
nice 👏 

[03/30/2023 13:57] loserdavictor
i don't think so because mint() is only happening in stake() and SafEth is minted,  but when rebalanceToWeights() called the contract unstakes everything and so has eth in its balance and then restakes but instead of going via stake() route, it just runs for loop... 

correct me if i am wrong?🐧 🐧


[03/30/2023 15:38] alexczm
Hi @Toshi, kindly check DM. ty!


[03/30/2023 16:12] aga7hokakological
What I meant is stake() -> rocketpool derivative (mints it's wrapped token) to the safEth -> safEth mints it's wrapped token to user

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/main/contracts/SafEth/derivatives/Reth.sol#L108 i wonder when the contract burn's the token, does it send the amount burned in terms of eth to the msg.sender? 
because there was no overridden function 

https://etherscan.io/address/0x1d8f8f00cfa6758d7bE78336684788Fb0ee0Fa46#code


[03/30/2023 17:35] aga7hokakological
why burnt amount will be sent to msg.sender? Here for Reth, sfrx, wst the msg.sender is safEth contract


[03/30/2023 17:39] 0xepley
hello, its my first audit, its written submit gas optimisation as one report, what they mean by that and how to submit as one repot,


[03/30/2023 17:39] loserdavictor
yep, i mean the msg.sender is contract will the eth transfer after withdraw() as i linked on github as the withdraw() internally burn() and so i assume the amount of eth won't be sent to safEth contract since there is no burn() overridden, it uses the generic one


[03/30/2023 17:40] 0xepley
@Toshi help me maalik


[03/30/2023 17:40] loserdavictor

this way if you have 3 gas findings... i did similar in first audit


[03/30/2023 17:41] aga7hokakological
```
 (bool sent, ) = address(msg.sender).call{value: address(this).balance}("");
```
This line does its work


[03/30/2023 17:41] to_sh_i_
This is not the same contract, burn is rETH's withdraw function

** 🙏   Please only take these steps if you need to make significant edits. There's no need to edit minor typos, etc. as those are not factored into judging.**

- Save your final QA/Gas report as a .md file
- Email the file to submissions@code423n4.com before contest close at  20:00:00
❗ **Be sure to include your C4 username** so we can attach your report to the correct submission.

This is a manual process so please be patient with us. We'll need time to process emailed submissions. Thank you!

The owner can add a new derivative and easily move all funds included in the contract to the new derivative. If the new derivative is an attack contract, investors' money will be lost entirely

Hm, I didn't receive an email despite seeing my submission in Findings during the contest


[04/01/2023 10:05] road220
For whoever is judging this contest I can offer up to 30% of my shares(there is a minimum payout of $500, if 30% < $500) for delivering some ambiguities on my submissions from github directly to me. I would love to help to resolve any confusions occurred over the time. I'm sorry @🧦 sockdrawer | C4 , i don't have any other opportunities to get +backstage because of this: https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/810931711609143326/1082437741586960485 and having no opportunity for something like that, seems not reasonable 😦

And it’s optimistic. It depends on project complexity and amount of findings (since most of them false positive). It the end on 2022 waiting time in 2 months was normal.


[04/14/2023 23:12] Cryptor#9119
A month would be a miracle. Remember it was the only active contest running at the time on C4. And the codebase was very small. That means a ton of submissions from auditors with nothing else to do, and unfortunately lower payouts

Guys be patient. It's not even been a month since the contest ended. Results usually take 1-2 months, so chill out. Many guys find this behavior annoying. And the fact is, this doesn't speeds up the judging process lol. That's why you will never find any senior doing this.

What's the meaning of total and unique?


[05/01/2023 19:52] eme0242
In total, # UNIQUE findings were found, and a TOTAL of # wardens contributed

How did you know your findings?


[05/01/2023 20:16] matin6517
Just assuming those got accepted😅

Congrats to all who submitted valid findings! 
Any chance to see what I submitted before report is made public?


[05/01/2023 20:45] whoismatthewmc1
This... is an unexpected development. Congrats everyone!
Thank you C4, Asymmetry team, and judges!

You will find the number of reports accepted for each warden here


[05/01/2023 21:24] road220
but where's the PR?


[05/01/2023 21:25] co0nan
I don't know if its got public before the report. not sure about this process. what you look for anyway


[05/01/2023 21:37] dadekuma
let's gooo 72 USDC for a few highs and mediums 😂

216 highs and 144 medium vulns, that's insane


[05/01/2023 21:52] oualidpro#8727
please I wasn't able to find my name in the list ... I am sure that at least the gas report was correct ... ? is there any problem with my submission ?


[05/01/2023 21:58] oualidpro#8727
please anyone can explain to me what was the problem with my submission ??


[05/01/2023 22:00] dadekuma
Most probably your report scored C, scores are relative to other reports. Your report must be better than the majority to have at least a B score


[05/01/2023 22:02] oualidpro#8727
but should the gas report include even the vulnerabilities that have been discovered by the automated scan ? to get a better score ?


[05/01/2023 22:03] dadekuma
no, those are ignored and not counted, you shouldn't include them


[05/01/2023 22:07] oualidpro#8727
I wish someone can tell me exactly what was the error I made to avoid it in my future submissions


[05/01/2023 22:12] co0nan
Believe me, if you stacked there trying to find what happens you will not improve, report take 3 months to get public. Take a rest and join the next contest.

but if I can't know where I messed things up ... I will keep doing the same error again and again


[05/01/2023 22:40] madalad
for gas & qa reports its likely just the amount of issues in the report that hurt your grade


[05/01/2023 23:40] 0xsmartcontractsamurai
I got nothing! 😂 🤣 😿 💩

I wonder how many wardens got nothing same with me haha. Better luck next time folks!  I wish everyone can have their share of reward pie someday. Keep grinding 👌


[05/02/2023 00:25] bluealder
how long until the report is published usually?

This was really competitive. Good for the the Asymmetry team. Kudos to the judges for such great work.

I'll buy myself a coffee, thanks. ☕ 
A lot of people, a lot of competition, interesting. I wonder how many contestants there were if almost 250 got prizes 🤯

The csv containing leaderboard data has been moved to another repo, so you won't see a PR -- but the data is still publicly available here: https://code4rena.com/community-resources/findings.csv

Made it to list. Interesting


[05/04/2023 20:09] infectedfuture
this makes me relativize haha, I'm pretty sure I found a medium (my first!) but the 13$ payout (and first payout!) made me think maybe it was just the QA


[05/04/2023 20:13] infectedfuture
oh I've just checked the csv and understood it, so no valid medium for this time :thisisfine:


[05/05/2023 15:23] 0xepley

People got 1 high, but payout is too small, something wrong with stats?

It's correct, some highs had a lot of duplicates which reduced its payout amount to dust

Now I'm curious af cause I didn't find that high and got like $15 for a single medium
